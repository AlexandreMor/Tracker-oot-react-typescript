## What is Zelda Ocarina of Time randomizer ?

This is a game released on Nintendo 64 in 1998 but in a randomized version. Thus, the items and songs in particular are no longer in the same places. The player will then have to think about the logic to be able to complete his seed (example "with what I know, my hookshot unlocks my bow etc").

## What is a Zelda Ocarina of Time randomizer tracker ?

With a tracker, you are able to note the items, medallions, stones and songs obtained. This tracker in particular makes it possible to note the places already visited, the keys obtained as well as to note the clues collected during the adventure. 
A character giving you an item or chest to open represents a check. If the check is red, the player cannot get the reward. Other items or songs are then needed for this. It will turn green as soon as all the prerequisites are met. In accordance with the rule enacted by the Zelda Speedrun community, the tracker does not analyze the logic of the seed. He is not able to know which bow was obtained first for example.

## Does this tracker support differents settings ?

Yes, but only some of them. Here is a list of the available settings :
Multiworld, Scrubsanity, Shopsanity, Planted Beans, Keysy, BossKeysy, Cowsanity, Zora Fountain Adult Open, Gerudo Valley Open, Open/Closed Deku, Skullsanity Dungeons, Dungeons Shuffle, Ganon's Castle Bridge (from 2 to 6 medallions), and Shuffle Merchants.

## What does multiworld setting do ?

It allows you to input more hints than usual and what item belongs to which player thanks to the field next to the spot name. Same thing for a hinted area.

## How do Paths/WOTH hints work ?

To mark an area as WOTH, Path, or Foolish, right-click on the zone name and select the corresponding information. Not selecting a boss to define an interesting area is equivalent to using the WOTHs, which simply provide you with a zone name to search for one or more major items within the game.

## How do sometimes hints work ?

Some spots have a 'plus' next to their name. Clicking on it allows you to pin the spot. Some of them are already displayed and represent the always hints, those that come back very regularly as their name suggests (this can vary depending on the distribution you choose when generating the seed). You can deselect them by clicking on 'minus'.

## What about random spawns ?

Only some spawns really matter for the logic. Here is a list :

    • Minuet
    • DMC lower
    • DMC upper
    • DMC fairy
    • DMT fairy
    • Zora’s River
    • Zora’s Domain
    • Zora's Fountain
    • Hyrule Castle Din's fairy
    • Gerudo’s Valley after bridge
    • Gerudo’s Fortress
    • Desert Colossus
    • Nocturne
    • Darunia room

## Can i hide an area when I full cleared it ?

Just click on the name of the area. Don't worry, you don't lose any information and you can click again to display the area.
